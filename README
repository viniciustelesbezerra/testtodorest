Done
I wish could have more time to do more grate things like:
All requests tests, invalid model tests etc...

You can see the tests coverage opening the file /coverage/index.html in your browser

Finished in 19.97 seconds
55 examples, 0 failures, 1 pending

Randomized with seed 52893

Coverage report generated for RSpec to /home/vinicius/projects/testtodorest/coverage. 107 / 107 LOC (100.0%) covered.

If i can do anything more let me know

And thanks for the challenge!
